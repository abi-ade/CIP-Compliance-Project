Company Background: 

Bright Utility Company (BUC) is a fictitious mid-sized utility company responsible for generating, transmitting, and distributing electricity across several regions in Alberta. Despite its robust infrastructure, the company has been facing challenges in maintaining compliance with Alberta Reliability Standards (ARS) Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) requirements.
Challenges:
•	BUC lacked comprehensive compliance processes, leading to inconsistent adherence to ARS CIP standards.
•	The company struggled with maintaining accurate and up-to-date regulatory evidence, risking non-compliance during audits.
•	There was limited collaboration between business units, resulting in fragmented compliance efforts.
•	Employees were not adequately trained on CIP requirements, leading to gaps in compliance knowledge and practices.

To address these challenges, BUC brought me on board as a consultant to review their existing processes, provide recommendations for improvements, and ensure full compliance with CIP requirements.

My Tasks:
•	Conduct thorough assessments of the client's current compliance status with ARS CIP standards.
•	Develop and implement comprehensive policies and procedures to address CIP requirements
•	Provide guidance on documentation, evidence collection, and audit response strategies.
•	Foster a culture of compliance and awareness within the organization

Deliverables:
•	A detailed report outlining the current compliance status, identified gaps, and recommended actions.
•	Comprehensive documents detailing the newly developed or updated policies and procedures.
•	Training modules, presentations, and interactive workshops designed to educate employees on CIP compliance.
